    <h2><em>Midnight Diner</em>'s Staple Menu Item: Tonjiru</h2>
    <p><em>Midnight Diner</em> is a Japanese slice of life show that details the chrnoicles of the patrons of the Midnight Diner, a diner that is only open from midnight to 7 a.m. in Tokyo's Shinjuku District. The head chef, affectionately known as "Master" to his patrons, prepares anything his patrons want as long as he has the ingredients for it. However, he only has four items on his menu: Shochu, Sake, Beer, and a Tonjiru meal. Since tonjiru is essentially the sole menu item, it will be the recipe featured from this show.</p>
    <p>Tonjiru is a heartier version of miso soup that features a few ingredients : root vegetables - particularly carrots, potatoes, burdock root, and daikon radish, mushrooms, tofu, konjac jelly, dashi broth, miso paste, and the most distinctive ingredient: pork belly. This recipe will be based off the soup that Master makes at the beginning of every <em>Midnight Diner</em> episode. Since a few of the ingredients are hard to find outside of Japan, visit a nearby Asian grocery store to find them. If there are none by you, feel free to substitute or omit some ingredients all together. </p>
    <p>By following this recipe, you should end up with a nice, comforting meal that is sure to fill you up, especially on a chilly day. Enjoy!</p>
