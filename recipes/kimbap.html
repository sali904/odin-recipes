    <h2>Attorney Woo's Favorite Food: Kimbap</h2>
    <p><em>Extraordinary Attorney Woo</em> is a Korean legal drama that chronicles the life of an autistic lawyer, Woo Young-woo, as she navigates working at a top law firm. She often faces challenges due to the very nature of working in an ableist, patriarchal society as an autistic woman. However, she still works hard to help others through her job as a lawyer and, as the series progresses, to further understand herself and the world around her. </p>
    <p>One distinctive characteristic of Woo Young-woo is her love for kimbap - a rice and seaweed roll that is often filled with a savory mix of protein and vegetables. Early in the show, Young-woo mentions that she <em>always</em> has "Woo Young-Woo kimbap" for breakfast (although she is shown eating a sandwich-like variation of kimbap made by her best friend Geu-rami for breakfast in another episode). "Woo Young-Woo kimnap" is a variation of classic kimbap - which consists of pickled radish, fish cake, carrots, spinach, eggs, and beef strips. However, instead of beef, Young-Woo's kimbap has ham in its place and also features crab sticks. The healthy and varied fillings make kimbap, whether it is in it's classic form or varied like Young-woo's or Geu-rami's kimbap, an excellent snack or meal to enjoy at any time and place. As Young-woo states in the show: "Kimbap is reliable". </p>
    <p>This recipe, courtesy of Korean Bapsang, may seem a bit intimidating to prepare at first, but trust me - it is actually pretty easy to prepare and <em>so</em> yummy. When you're done, turn on an episode of <em>Extraordinary Attorney Woo</em>and enjoy!</p>
